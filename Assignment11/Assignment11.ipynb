    "### April 9, 2021\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## A - Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide you with instructions for completing the assignment.  *Be sure to answer all the questions in this notebook.*  Each member of the group must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file) to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at an example of processing and analysing data in the domain of soil science. Soil moisture is a critical variable that links climate dynamics with water and food security. Information on soil moisture is a key factor to inform and enable precision agriculture. The current availability in soil moisture data over large areas comes from remote sensing (i.e., satellites with radar sensors) which provide daily, nearly global coverage of soil moisture. However, satellite soil moisture datasets have a major shortcoming in that they are limited to coarse spatial resolution (generally no finer than tens of kilometers). There do exist at higher resolution other geographic datasets (e.g., climatic, geological, and topographic) that are intimately related to soil moisture values, which can be paired with soil moisture data in order to downscale (i.e., increase resolution) the original soil moisture product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last assignment, we performed some early stages of data downscaling using a common and powerful Python package for data analysis: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we execute a fully developed workflow to reproduce scientific experiments using powerful machine learning methods (i.e., KNN, Surrogate-based Model, HYPPO, and Random Forest).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup of the SOMOSPIE workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This process consists of two major steps: \n",
    "* (1) creating a new virtual machine in Jetstream from a custom VM image; \n",
    "* (2) cloning the SOMOSPIE GitHub repository on your new VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to: \n",
    "* Setup and run the full SOMOSPIE workflow;\n",
    "* Use SOMOSPIE to partially reproduce a published study on one region with multiple machine learning methods;\n",
    "* Use SOMOSPIE to downscale soil moisture using one method across multiple regions;\n",
    "* Use Pandas to analyze the reported accuracies ($R^2$ and $RMSE$) of the predictions across multiple regions and months.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will report the results of your experiments within this Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT:  Do **not** push a copy of the SOMOSPIE repo in your class repo."

    "## B - SOMOSPIE Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a new VM\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jetstream (https://use.jetstream-cloud.org), launch an m1.medium Virtual Machine (VM) using the SOMOSPIE image found here: https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/946. You can launch an instance based on an image with the launch button in the top right -- just make sure you pick the project you want to have the instance in! Consult the JetstreamGuide.ipynb for instructions on launching a VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Clone the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inside your new virtual machine**, clone the SOMOSPIE repository:\n",
    "* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/TauferLab/SOMOSPIE`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set up environment  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening the SOMOSPIE notebook, we need to update the `.bashrc`:\n",
    "* `cd SOMOSPIE`\n",
    "* `make bash`\n",
    "* `source ~/.bashrc`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Load data and run simple test\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open the notebook `SOMOSPIE.ipynb` and in the `Cell` menu select `Run All`. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: The first time you run it may take 45 minutes. The reason is because you are loading the data from public datasets."
