    "# COSC 526 - Assignment in Lecture 03\n",
    "### February 5, 2021\n",

    "The solutions to this assignment are **due on Feb 15, 2021 (before 8AM ET).**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide you with basic functions for completing the assignment.  *Complete the assignment in this notebook.  You will need to modify existing code and write new code to find a solution*.  Each member of the group must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file) to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes, you can find the solutions online, but why looking for a solution if you can find it by brainstorming with your peers and challenging yourself? Try not to look for a solution at least until the end of this lecture. Unleash your imagination, build a network of peers by finding your own solution.**\n",

    "- Running a cell will not rerun previous cells.  If you edit code in previous cells, you must rerun those cells.  We recommend using* `Run All` to avoid any errors results from not rerunning previous cells.  You can find this in the menu above:* `Cell -> Run All`\n",
    "\n",
    "- When solving a programming problem such as Problems 1-3 below, it is generally a bad idea to try and optimize your program in your first attempt. Rather than implementing clever algorithms right away, it is better to write a simple script that you are certain will work and is easier to debug. Once your script runs correctly (possibly with smaller input than the final problem you wish to solve), commit your working solution to your GitHub repository, then you can think about how to improve it."

    "## Problem 1:\n",
    "(From [ProjectEuler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).) If we list the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get: 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function that finds the sum of the multiples of $p$ or $q$ below $N$. \n",

To meet the performance constraints, you will have to implement the fast approach.\n",
